#SS_SHIELDEMITTER_NAME: Shield Emitter
#SS_SHIELDEMITTER_DESC: Installing additional shield emitters on the surface of the hull increases the maximum amount of shield systems (generator, charger, hardener) that can be installed on a ship. Due to the fact these emitters are largely internal and have to be connected to the ship's power source, they take up considerable amounts of internal space.

#SS_PFW_NAME: Polarizing Flux Weapon
#SS_PFW_DESC: The Polarizing Flux Weapon, or P.F.W. for short, creates and accelerates a local dynamically changing strong electromagnetic field. Upon contact with an energy shield, the constant fluctuation in strength, polarity and alignment overloads the shields' capacity, thus weakening it considerably. Because the field is drawn towards the target, this weapon usually does not miss.\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Does not inflict damage upon armor, subsystems and hulls

#SS_XRAYLASER_NAME: Laser (X-Ray)
#SS_XRAYLASER_DESC: By shifting the wavelength towards the UV and X-Ray spectrum, a higher impulse than conventional lasers offer can be achieved. This decreases the beam's dispersion over distance, thus offering more range at less damage and slightly higher energy cost.\n#tab:8##c:green#+ 40% more Range\n#tab:8##c:green#+ 20% less Heat\n#tab:8##c:d00#- 30% less Damage\n#tab:8##c:d00#- 25% more energy consumed

#SS_TRAYEMITT_NAME: T-Ray Emitter
#SS_TRAYEMITT_DESC: Shields operate in a broad wavelength range, able to absorb or weakon almost anything. However, there is a small gap between infrared and microwave wavelength that is usually used by sensors, but not by weapons-grade emitters. The Terahertz Radiation Emitter operates in this wavelength, exploiting any shield's weakness.\n#tab:8##c:green#+ Completely ignores shields\n#tab:8##c:d00#- low damage\n#tab:8##c:d00#- high energy cost

#SS_FROCKETS_NAME: Rockets (Fighter/Bomber)

#SS_FLASEROC_NAME: Overcharged Laser (Fighter/Bomber)
#SS_FLASEROC_DESC: While regular fighter lasers provide a reliable and durable weapon system, they lack the power output necessary to damage heavily armored targets. By increasing the laser output to the maximum strength possible without damaging the firing mechanism, the damage per shot can be increased significantly.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Very high damage output\n#tab:8##c:d00#- High power consumption\n#tab:8##c:d00#- Generates a lot of heat

#SS_FIGHTERPC_NAME: Particle Cannon (Fighter/Bomber)
#SS_FIGHTERPC_DESC: Advancements in miniaturization allow the use of powerful particle cannons on small strike craft. This weapon provides heavy damage and long range at the cost of power consumption and heat generation.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Very high damage output\n#tab:8##c:d00#- High power consumption\n#tab:8##c:d00#- Generates a lot of heat\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Deals 20% more damage to shields

#SS_AMPROJECTOR_NAME: Antimatter Projector
#SS_AMPROJECTOR_DESC: Antimatter Projectors are fueled by the anti-particles generated by an antimatter generator. By isolating them in a spacetime-bending tunnel, they can be stored and projected. As soon as they collide with normal matter, the subsequent matter-antimatter annihilation causes a powerful chain reaction, often completely destroying the target in the process.\n#tab:8##c:green#++ Extremely high damage\n#tab:8##c:d00#- High energy cost\n#tab:8##c:d00#- Low rate of fire\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Requires an antimatter generator\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Deals 20% more damage to shields

#SS_FIRESTORM_NAME: Firestorm Defense

#SS_PLANETPC_NAME: Planetary Particle Cannon
#SS_PLANETPC_DESC: The planetary Particle Cannon works just like the ship-mounted version. It provides higher damage, range and projectile velocity than most other defensive installations. The loss of energy caused by the atmosphere requires a higher charge per shot, though, effectively limiting the rate of fire.

#SS_HEAVYBOMB_NAME: Heavy Bomb (Bomber)
#SS_HEAVYBOMB_DESC: The Heavy Bomb mainly consists of a very large warhead, that deals a great amount of damage upon impact. There are no special features like shield or armor penetration - it blows things apart by sheer force.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ High damage\n#c:d00##tab:8#- Low ammo count

#SS_EMPBOMB_NAME: EMP Bomb (Bomber)
#SS_EMPBOMB_DESC: By emitting a strong enough electromagnetic pulse, even shields are weakened.

#SS_SHIELDEDANTIMATGEN_NAME: Shielded Antimatter Generator
#SS_SHIELDEDANTIMATGEN_DESC: Usually, antimatter generators that become unstable lead to what is commonly known as "explosive decompression" of a ship, meaning total destruction of it. Shielded Antimatter Generators have a strong containment field that prevents the matter-antimatter annihilation reaction from becoming too powerful once the core collapses, thus preventing the ship's destruction. The main drawback of the shielding is increased heat build-up.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Does not explode\n#c:d00##tab:8#- Slightly lower power output\n#c:d00##tab:8#- Massive\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Minimum size is scale * size = 1

#SS_ZEROPOINTGEN_NAME: Zero-Point Generator
#SS_ZEROPOINTGEN_DESC: While not as powerful as an antimatter generator, the Zero-Point Generator, harnessing zero-point (or more precisely, vacuum) energy, has one distinct advantage: It's lack of a fuel requirement.

#SS_ANTISURFACEWARHEAD_NAME: Anti-Surface Warhead
#SS_ANTISURFACEWARHEAD_DESC: These weapons of mass destruction are specially designed to inflict maximum damage on planetary surfaces. This is achieved by attuning the warhead's mechanism to a target planets atmospheric composition, thus reaching maximum destructive capability.\n#c:green##tab:8#++Very powerful against planets\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Extremely low range\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Can only target planets

#SS_PLANETBUSTER_NAME: Planet Buster
#SS_PLANETBUSTER_DESC: This weapon penetrates the planetary crust before detonation, which causes tectonic instabilities and volcanic eruptions as well as damage to the planets core. A few of these - if not even one - can destroy almost any planet with ease, making it a truly terrifying weapon.\n#c:green##tab:8#+++Can easily depopulate or destroy planets\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Extremely low range\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Can only target planets\n#c:d00##tab:8#- Explodes when destroyed\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Needs to be fired manually via the right-click menu\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Minimum subsystem size 1200

#SS_FBASW_NAME: Anti-Surface Bomb (Fighter/Bomber)
#SS_FBASW_DESC: Similar to the Anti-Surface Warhead, Anti-Surface Bombs are designed to be used against targets on a planets surface. They are powerful, but require the craft carrying it to get very close to the target.\n#c:green##tab:8#++Very powerful against planets\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Extremely low range\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Can only target planets

#SS_NBCWEAPON_NAME: NBC Warhead
#SS_NBCWEAPON_DESC: This advanced bomb uses a mix of Nanotechnological, Biological and Chemical (NBC) warfare agents to wear down and destroy even the most barricaded enemy. It can not be blocked or weakened by anything, which makes it one of the most lethal options available.\n#c:green##tab:8#+Attacks the population directly\n#c:green##tab:8#+Leaves all structures intact to capture\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Extremely low range

#SS_HELIOCIDE_NAME: Heliocide Hull
#SS_HELIOCIDE_DESC: Project Heliocide is superweapon that, once unlocked, makes it possible to commit what can only be described as "stellar atrocity" - that is, rapidly accelerating a star's lifecycle, ultimately leading to its collapse and destruction.\n#c:green##tab:8#++++Can destroy stars...\n#c:d00##tab:8#-... which will most likely destroy the ship as well\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Can only target stars\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Needs to be fired manually via the right-click menu\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Unable to use Jump Drives\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Can not carry weapons\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Size must be > 1000

#SS_FORTRESSHULL_NAME: Fortress Hull
#SS_FORTRESSHULL_DESC: With huge, heavily armed ships posing a deadly threat to planets, the only way to counter it using stational or orbital installations is by applying the same techniques for ship hulls to stations. The Fortress is not only durable, but it also provides space for a main gun battery that covers it's entire radius.\n#c:green##tab:8#++Extremely durable\n#c:green##tab:8#++Very spacious\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Expensive\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Can be linked to a weapon subsystem\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Size must be > 1000\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Hull space increase at scale 2000 and 3000

#SS_GATLASER_NAME: Laser (Pulsed)
#SS_GATLASER_DESC: Instead of emitting a contiuous beam for a short period of time, Pulsed Lasers fire extremely short bursts of laser pulses. While each short pulse isn't very powerful, this enables very high rates of fire. The only drawback of this is the need for cooling and recalibration phases after prolonged periods of firing.\n#c:green##tab:8#++Extremely high rate of fire\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Low damage/shot\n#c:d00##tab:8#-25% less range\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Long cooling periods between bursts\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Provides Point Defense

#SS_GATLINGTURRET_NAME: Gatling Turret
#SS_GATLINGTURRET_DESC: Gatling Turrets were developed with one target in mind: Achieving ridiculously high rates of fire. Besides being effective against fighter craft and small ships, they also provide Point Defense against missile-type weapons.\n#c:green##tab:8#+++Extremely high rate of fire\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Low damage/shot\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Low range\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Long cooling periods between bursts\n#c:d00##tab:8#-High ammo consumption\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Provides Point Defense

#SS_EXMAG_NAME: Extended Magazine
#SS_EXMAG_DESC: The firing mechanisms and ammunition magazines of Missile Racks and several other weapons can be modified and enlarged, providing longer salvos.\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Can extend the salvo size of linked Missile Racks, Gatling Turrets, Pulsed Lasers and Fighter Rockets

#SS_LONGRANGELASER_NAME: Infinity Cannon
#SS_LONGRANGELASER_DESC: Just point this thing and shoot. Makes things go "boom".

#SS_TWINRAILGUN_NAME: Twin Railgun
#SS_TWINRAILGUN_DESC: Advances in miniaturization techniques enable us to decrease the size of railguns significantly. Twin railgun turrets fire twice before reloading, at the same damage and range of the standard version. However, by doing so they are far less durable and more heavy than normal, and their rate of fire is decreased.\n#c:green##tab:8#+High Alpha\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Low rate of fire\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Heavy, expensive and not very durable

#SS_TWINHEAVYRAILGUN_NAME: Twin Railgun (Heavy)
#SS_TWINHEAVYRAILGUN_DESC: Heavy Twin Railguns function just like their regular counterpart, except they fire in bursts of two shots, at the same damage and range of the single version. Their construction requires significant design changes, which make them vulnerable and heavy as well as reduce their rate of fire.\n#c:green##tab:8#+Very high Alpha\n#c:green##tab:8#+High range\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Very low rate of fire\n#c:d00##tab:8#-High ammo consumption\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Heavy, expensive and not very durable

#SS_ASSAULTCANNON_NAME: Assault Cannon
#SS_ASSAULTCANNON_DESC: While Heavy and Twin Heavy Railguns offer excellent first-strike capabilities in terms of range and damage per shot, they lack precision. The Assault Cannon is a triple-barreled weapon system designed to reliably deliver tremendous burst damage over large distances. In addition to its precision and damage, its projectiles are very complex, making use of advanced anti-shield technology.\n#c:green##tab:8#++Completely ignores Shields\n#c:green##tab:8#++Precise\n#c:green##tab:8#+High Alpha and range\n#c:d00##tab:8#--Very low rate of fire\n#c:d00##tab:8#-High ammo consumption\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Massive and expensive

#SS_TWINPLASMAGUN_NAME: Twin Plasma Thrower
#SS_TWINPLASMAGUN_DESC: By reducing the size and amount of non-vital components, Plasma Throwers can be made small enough to be able to install two instead of just one in the same amount of space. They fire 2-shot bursts with regular range and damage at an increased firing delay. While durability is low, cost and mass are increased.\n#c:green##tab:8#+High Alpha\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Low rate of fire\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Draws large amounts of power when firing\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Heavy, expensive and not very durable

#SS_TWINPARTICANNON_NAME: Twin Particle Cannon
#SS_TWINPARTICANNON_DESC: The Twin Particle Cannon, much like the Twin Railgun, for example, excels in dealing high Alpha damage at long range. This comes at the expense of low durability, high mass and cost as well as prolonged firing delays.\n#c:green##tab:8#+Very high Alpha\n#c:green##tab:8#+High range\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Very low rate of fire\n#c:d00##tab:8#-High power consumption\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Heavy, expensive and not very durable\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Deals 20% more damage to shields

#SS_POINTDEFENSE_NAME: Point Defense
#SS_POINTDEFENSE_DESC: Salvos of advanced missiles and powerful torpedos pose a great threat to any spaceship. Because they are slow-moving and can usually be detected at long range, it is possible to intercept at least a significant portion of them. Point Defense systems specialize in detecting and destroying incoming guided projectile weapons, making missile and torpedo attacks less dangerous.\n#c:green##tab:8#+Can intercept incoming missiles\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Can't do anything else

#SS_MOTHERSHIPHULL_NAME: Mothership Hull
#SS_MOTHERSHIPHULL_DESC: If the Gargantuan Hull is the ultimate for assault-oriented ship designs, this is the ultimate in carrier design. While the overall space available as ship bay is not as extreme as what the carrier hull offers, the Mothership Hull is much more durable and offers a lot of extra space for support systems, weapons and defenses. \n#c:green##tab:8#+Very large ship bay\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Expensive\n#c:d00##tab:8#-Not as strong as the Gargantuan Hull\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Requires a minimum scale 3600\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Can not mount additional ship bays\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Hull space increase at scale 7200 and 10800

#SS_HDFUELCELL_NAME: High Density Fuel Storage
#SS_HDFUELCELL_DESC: While standard fuel cells are equipped with directed blast mitigation and containment systems, these fuel storages forego such safety measures in favor of greatly increased fuel storage capacity.\n#c:green##tab:8#+Double fuel capacity\n#c:d00##tab:8# -Very fragile\n#c:d00##tab:8#- Explodes when destroyed

#SS_HDAMMOCACHE_NAME: High Density Ammo Storage
#SS_HDAMMOCACHE_DESC: These large ammo storages make up in capacity what they lack in durability; they are completely devoid of safety measures like blast containment systems, though, making them dangerous to use.\n#c:green##tab:8#+Double ammo capacity\n#c:d00##tab:8# -Very fragile\n#c:d00##tab:8#- Explodes when destroyed

#SS_MASSDRIVER_NAME: Large Mass Driver
#SS_MASSDRIVER_DESC: Though asteroids usually contain ferromagnetic elements, their concentration and distribution is too irregular to allow for them to be fired using electromagnetic railguns. Finally, advances in gravitics make it possible to aim and accelerate them at planets by means of gravitational manipulation.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Heavy damage on impact\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Slowly generates ammunition\n#c:d00##tab:8#- Does not use regular ammunition\n#c:d00##tab:8#- May only attack planets\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Uses asteroids as ammunition\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Minimum size 100

#SS_MASSDRIVERLIGHT_NAME: Mass Driver
#SS_MASSDRIVERLIGHT_DESC: Mass Drivers are engineered towards accelerating asteroids with as much mass as possible. Precision or projectile velocity are only secondary and tertiary concerns. While they are unreliable at hitting targets at long range, their tremendous impact damage makes more than up for it.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Heavy Alpha\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Slowly generates ammunition\n#c:d00##tab:8#- Does not use regular ammunition\n#c:d00##tab:8#- Inaccurate\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Uses asteroids as ammunition

#SS_FCUTTER_NAME: Fusion Cutter
#SS_FCUTTER_DESC: A derivate from the Ion Beam and Laser technologies, the Fusion Cutter combines both techniques with gravitational acceleration. A narrow stream of Helium isotopes is fired at a target, and upon impact, ignited by extremely high-powered laser pulses. The resulting reaction is so strong that it may initiate a short-lived fusion reaction, causing severe damage through consecutive explosions.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Extremely high damage\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Fires constantly\n#c:d00##tab:8#- Short range\n#c:d00##tab:8#- High amount of excess heat\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Can cause critical hits for 2.5x damage

#SS_FLANCE_NAME: Fusion Lance
#SS_FLANCE_DESC: Instead of firing a continuous stream of Helium isotopes and igniting them in bursts like the Fusion Cutter does, the Fusion Lance emits a short, condensed pulse, potentially piercing through multiple layers of armor. Similar to the Fusion Cutter, the Fusion Lance also has a small chance of inflicting much more damage by igniting a fusion reaction.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Extremely high Alpha\n#c:d00##tab:8#- Short range\n#c:d00##tab:8#- High amount of excess heat\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Can cause critical hits for 2.5x damage

#SS_ASTROCOL_NAME: Asteroid Collector
#SS_ASTROCOL_DESC: While Mass Drivers are equipped with small-scale asteroid collectors, these can only capture small asteroids, limiting the rate at which the asteroid storage can be filled. These specialized asteroid collectors can store larger amounts of asteroids and collect them at an increased rate.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Generates and stores Mass Driver ammunition (asteroids)\n#c:d00##tab:8#- Does not store/generate regular ammunition

#SS_HEATSINK_NAME: Heatsink
#SS_HEATSINK_DESC: While coolant systems linked to a weapon can increase the rate of fire and lower the amount of waste heat per shot, they do not increase the heat release and maximum heat capacity. The heatsink is a subsystem dedicated to managing the excess heat and technical issues that arise when using high-powered energy weaponry and is meant to complement the ship's reactor.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Increases heat release and heat threshold\n#c:d00##tab:8#- Takes up internal space

#SS_AMCANNON_NAME: Antimatter Cannon
#SS_AMCANNON_DESC: This weapon shoots projectiles that contain a small amount of antiparticles. They detonate on contact or in proximity of a target and deal large amounts of damage due to the resulting antimatter-matter annihilation reaction.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ High damage\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Large explosion radius\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Effective against small ship formations\n#tab:8##c:d00#- Can't attack targets at close range\n#tab:8##c:d00#-- High ammo consumption\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Requires an antimatter generator

#SS_INTERCEPTMISS_NAME: Interceptor Missile
#SS_INTERCEPTMISS_DESC: Advances in missile technology allow faster, more precise missile weapons. This type of missile is designed to keep strike craft at a distance. Due to its high rate of fire it is effective at this task, while it fails to deal sufficient damage against larger targets.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Good against strike craft\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Long range\n#tab:8##c:d00#- Low DPS\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: Offers at least 50% hit chance against fighters and bombers.

#SS_CLUSTERMISS_NAME: Cluster Missile
#SS_CLUSTERMISS_DESC: While not as precise or maneuverable as the Interceptor Missile, the Cluster Missile, once in proximity to a target, releases a group of smaller warheads into all directions, hitting multiple targets at once.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Area of Effect\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Fair range\n#tab:8##c:d00#- Low DPS

#SS_TACHYONBLASTER_NAME: Tachyon Blaster
#SS_TACHYONBLASTER_DESC: The Tachyon Blaster is, strictly speaking, no weapon in the usual sense. It doesn't emit anything directly, but locates multiple tachyon streams, focuses them and then redirects them towards a target. When they merge, the resulting explosion emits extreme heat and radiation, severely damaging and possibly destroying anything close to it. The superluminal velocity of these particles allows extreme precision even at long range.\n#c:green##tab:8#++ Incomparable range\n#tab:8##c:d00#- Low DPS\n#tab:8##c:d00#- Can't attack targets at close range

#SS_CARGOMETAL_NAME: Cargo Unit (Metal)
#SS_CARGOMETAL_DESC: This cargo unit is designed for the transportation of refined metal only. While it can't load anything else, it offers 20% more metal storage than a cargo bay does.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ 20% Larger metal storage\n#tab:8##c:d00#- May only store metal

#SS_CARGOORE_NAME: Cargo Unit (Ore)

#SS_AMCONV_NAME: Antimatter Converter
#SS_AMCONV_DESC: Some advanced propulsion or weapon systems may utilize the great amount of energy that is set free during an antimatter/matter-annihilation. To allow this, an antimatter-generating subsystem of sufficient size, such as an AM generator or converter, must be present.\n#c:green##tab:8#+ Generates antimatter...\n#tab:8##c:d00#- ...but doesn't do anything else\n#tab:8##c:d00#- Does not provide power

#SS_PMOD_NAME: Precision Mod
#SS_PMOD_DESC: If firepower is less important than range, most weapons can be modified to sacrifice damage and cost per shot for increased range and precision. The range increase offered by this method is significantly larger than that of a targetting array.\n#c:green##tab:8#++ Significantly boosts weapon range\n#tab:8##c:d00#- Reduces damage per cost\n#tab:8##c:d00#- Increased cost per shot

#SS_PLANETDEFNET_NAME: Planetary Defense Network
#SS_PLANETDEFNET_DESC: With advances being made in the development of ballistic weapons, the use of smaller, less powerful defensive cannons becomes feasible. While range and damage output are low, the rate of fire is significantly higher than that of other planetary weapons.

#SS_TERRAFORM_DESC: Scientific advances allow the of shaping a planet to our own needs. This allows changing the atmospheric conditions by a large amount, turning toxic gases into breathable air, changing weather patterns. Further use may allow reclamation of land from the oceans, creating entire new artifical continents therefore creating new living space on the planet.

#SS_SPATDISTGEN_NAME: Spatial Distortion Generator
#SS_SPATDISTGEN_DESC: A true, unmatched marvel of space-time distortion technology, the Spatial Distortion Generator can be used to distort, twist and rearrange regions of space as large as stars themselves. This allows to accelerate the natural combustion process within a star, either bringing it close to its death and making it extremely vulnerable to outside influences or destroying it immediately.\n\nThe weapon requires an extreme amount of power before firing and due to that it can't be stored safely and so requires 10 minutes to charge each time it fires.\n#c:green##tab:8#After firing takes 10 minutes to be ready to activate again.

#SS_REMNANTIONCANNON_NAME: Remnant Relativistic Annihilator
#SS_REMNANTIONCANNON_DESC: Created out of technology that is still not fully understood, the Relativistic Annihilator seems to ionize particles within a vast region of space, attracts them and focuses them into a single point. This creates a small, yet extremely dense object, which is then accelerated to near lightspeed. A planet hit by this horrifying weapon, if not destroyed, is at least sterilized of all lifeforms; detecting this projectile before impact is next to impossible due to the speed.

#SS_ZPFGEN_NAME: Zero Point Field Generator
#SS_ZPFGEN_DESC: Seemingly intended as a special kind of defense mechanism, this weapon doesn't damage targets at all. Instead, it drains all charge from their capacitors, effectively causing the target to go offline.

#SS_STARGATE_NAME: Jump Bridge
#SS_STARGATE_DESC: These mysterious, ancient structures allow travelling vast distances once linked to another jump bridge. To link a captured jump bridge to another, select the first one, then click on the second one and select "link to stargate". To use this jump route, select a ship, right-click on the jump bridge and select "enter stargate".

#SS_WAVEGUN_NAME: Wave Emitter
#SS_WAVEGUN_DESC: This weapon sends out directed waves of space-time distortions, which, upon contact with matter, disrupt and dissolve this matter regardless of its properties or density.\n#c:green##tab:8#++ Ignores armor DR\n#tab:8##c:d00#- Low DPS\n#tab:8##c:d00#- Very expensive technology\n#c:ee0##tab:8#Note: This weapons completely ignores damage reduction

#doc res title: Resources
#doc res text: There are many types of resources in the game. The main economic ones are:
#doc res note0 title: Ore
#doc res note0 text: #c:09f#Ore#c# represents the raw natural resources available for further refinery. Ore is present at game start in large quantities on planets, where it is mined into #c:09f#metals#c# by #c:0fa#metal mining complexes#c#.\n\nLater in the game, ore can also be #c:f90#mined from asteroids#c# by equipping ships with the #c:0fa#mining beam#c#.
#doc res note1 title: Metals
#doc res note1 text: #c:09f#Metals#c# are the refined alloys used to build hulls and constructions. They are the easiest resource to produce and are required in large quantities for ship construction.\n\nMetals are refined from #c:09f#ore#c# by #c:0fa#metal mining complexes#c# on planets and by ships equipped with the #c:0fa#metal refinery#c# sub system.
#doc res note2 title: Electronics
#doc res note2 text: #c:09f#Electronics#c# are more sophisticated forms of equipment. They represent the wiring and general systems required for advanced technology to function.\n\nElectronics are produced from #c:09f#metals#c#. Each unit of electronics requires #c:f90#two units of metals#c# to produce.\n\nElectronics are created by #c:0fa#electronics factories#c# on planets and by ships equipped with the #c:0fa#electronics fabricator#c# sub system.
#doc res note3 title: Advanced Parts
#doc res note3 text: #c:09f#Advanced Parts#c# are the components needed for complex technological systems to function.\n\nAdvanced Parts are produced from #c:09f#metals#c# and #c:09f#electronics#c#. Each unit of advanced parts requires #c:f90#one unit of metals#c# and #c:f90#one unit of electronics#c#.\n\n\Advanced Parts are created by #c:0fa#advanced parts factories#c# on planets and by ships equipped with the #c:0fa#advanced parts assembler#c# sub system.
#doc res note4 title: Food
#doc res note4 text: In order for your population to #c:f90#survive or even grow#c#, your people require #c:09f#food#c#.\n\nFood is produced by #c:0fa#farms#c# on planets, their effectiveness determined by your #c:0fa#Biology#c# technology level.\n\nIf you run out of food, your people may die and you will start losing planets to famine.
#doc res note5 title: General Goods
#doc res note5 text: #c:09f#Goods#c# are the basic items required for your population to have a satisfying lifestyle.\n\nLacking goods will greatly reduce the #c:09f#mood#c# of the population on your planets, which has disastrous effects on your economy as a whole.\n\nGoods are produced by #c:0fa#general goods factories#c# on planets.
#doc res note6 title: Luxuries
#doc res note6 text: #c:09f#Luxuries#c# are any non-essential goods your population consumes in the pursuit of their happiness.\n\nHaving sufficient luxuries will greatly increase the #c:09f#mood#c# of the population on your planets, which has beneficial effects on your economy as a whole.\n\nLuxuries are produced by #c:0fa#luxuries factories#c# on planets.
#doc res note7 title: Labor
#doc res note7 text: Each of your planets produces a certain amount of #c:09f#labor#c#. Labor is used to put resources together and create the final product that is being constructed.\n\nLabor is generated by #c:f90#population#c# and by #c:0fa#shipyards#c# on a planet.\n\nLabor can only be used on the planet it is generated on.
#doc res note8 title: Fuel
#doc res note8 text: #c:09f#Fuel#c# is the resource needed for the building of ships with engines that require fuel.\n\nFuel is produced from either #c:09f#food#c# or #c:09f#helium 3#c#. Each unit of fuel requires #c:f90#one unit of food#c# or #c:f90#half a unit of helium 3#c#.\n\n\Fuel is created by #c:0fa#Fuel Depots#c# or #c:0fa#Helium Refineries#c# on planets and by ships equipped with the #c:0fa#Helium 3 Refinery#c# sub system.
#doc res note9 title: Ammo
#doc res note9 text: #c:09f#Ammo#c# is the resource needed for the building and function of military ships with weapons that require it to function.\n\nAmmo is produced from #c:09f#metals#c#. Each unit of ammo requires #c:f90#half a unit of metals#c#.\n\n\Ammo is created by #c:0fa#Ammo Depots#c# on planets and by ships equipped with the #c:0fa#Ammo Refinery#c# sub system.
#doc res note10 title: Helium 3
#doc res note10 text: #c:09f#Helium 3#c# represents the raw natural resources available for further refinery. Helium is present at game start in large quantities on gas type planets, where it is refined into #c:09f#fuel#c# by #c:0fa#helium refineries#c#.\n\nLater in the game, he3 can also be #c:f90#harvested from certain stars#c# by equipping ships with the #c:0fa#helium 3 harvester#c#.
#doc pri title: Economic Principles
#doc pri text: The basic principles involved in the workings of the economy:
#doc pri note0 title: Stored Resources
#doc pri note0 text: Each planet has its own #c:f90#individual stored resources#c#. Only the resources stored on a planet may be used to construct #c:09f#ships#c# and #c:09f#structures#c#.\n\nWhile a planet is selected, the amount of resources present can be seen in the right section of the #c:09f#object information panel#c# at the bottom of the screen.
#doc pri note1 title: Galactic Bank
#doc pri note1 text: The #c:09f#galactic bank#c# is your empire's global resource pool. #c:0fa#Space ports#c# constructed on planets can import and export stored resources to and from the galactic bank at a certain rate, and are an important part of moving resources through your empire. These space ports also provide extra trade that can be used by subsystems based on ships.\n\nThe current stored amounts in the galactic bank can be seen in the top left panel. The current extra trade capacity is also shows here.
#doc pri note2 title: Bank Resources
#doc pri note2 text: The galactic bank can store #c:09f#Advanced Parts#c#, #c:09f#Electronics#c#, #c:09f#Metals#c#, #c:09f#Food#c#, #c:09f#Fuel#c#, #c:09f#Ammo#c#, #c:09f#Goods#c# and #c:09f#Luxuries#c#.\n\nGoods and Luxuries are not transported to and from the bank by #c:0fa#space ports#c#, but are instead produced into and consumed directly from the galactic bank.
#doc pri note3 title: Bank Rates
#doc pri note3 text: To the right of the galactic bank display in the top left are two buttons.\n\nThe top button toggles the bank display between #c:f90#currently stored resources#c# and #c:f90#average income rate per second#c#.\n\nThe lower button opens the #c:09f#economy report window#c#, displaying income and expense rates in more detail.
#doc pri note4 title: Blockades
#doc pri note4 text: Systems with an overwhelming amount of enemies are considered #c:09f#blockaded#c#. Resources cannot be ferried to and from space ports or any type of dock due to enemy interference and as such, any access to the galactic bank within the solar system is disabled.\n\nTo lift the blockade, bring in combat ships of your own to prevent the enemy from blockading.
#doc pri note5 title: Economy Report
#doc pri note5 text: The economy report window displays statistics for each resource.\n\n#c:0fa#Net#c# indicates the net change in your stores per second.\n#c:0fa#Income#c# is how much your economy produces per second.\n#c:0fa#Expenses#c# are your economy's actual consumptions per second.\n#c:0fa#Demand#c# is how many extra resources are needed per second to satisfy your empire's requirements.
#doc pri note6 title: Civil Acts
#doc pri note6 text: #c:09f#Civil Acts#c# are various decrees that you can issue to affect your empire's economy.\n\nCivil acts can be controlled from the #c:09f#civil acts window#c#, which can be accessed by pressing the #c:0f0#civil acts button#c# in the #c:09f#empire window#c#.
#doc pl before: Before you lies your #c:0fa#home planet#c#, the first of many planets that your empire will encompass.\n\n#c:09f#Planets#c# are a vital part of your economy, producing resources and constructing ships.\n\nIn this section of the docorial the various aspects of controlling your planets will be explained.
#doc pl title: Planets
#doc pl text: Forming the core of your economy, planets are vital to your success.
#doc pl note0 title: Colonization
#doc pl note0 text: The main aspect of empire expansion is #c:f90#colonization#c#. You will be building #c:0fa#colony ships#c# to settle on planets both in your home system and in others.\n\nA colony ship can only be used to colonize a single planet, and is used up in the process.
#doc pl note1 title: Structures and Slots
#doc pl note1 text: In order to make planets useful, you must build #c:09f#structures#c#.\n\nEach planet has a set amount of #c:09f#structure slots#c#, indicating the amount of structures that can be built on it.\n\nPlanets also have a certain amount of slots that can accessed with planetary improvements later in the game to increase the number of available slots.\n\nThe benefits provided by structures range from #c:f90#producing resources#c# to #c:f90#generating research points#c# and #c:f90#housing population#c#.
#doc pl note2 title: Governors
#doc pl note2 text: As emperor, you will not be commanding each individual structure to be built. Instead, you can assign #c:0fa#governor types#c# to each planet.\n\nThe planetary governor, when turned on, will #c:f90#automatically build appropriate structures#c#.
#doc pl note3 title: Population
#doc pl note3 text: Each planet has the capacity to house an amount of #c:f90#population#c#, depending on the amount of #c:0fa#cities#c# constructed on the planet and your #c:0fa#Sociology#c# technology level.\n\nPopulation is required to run other structures, and having more of it will increase your #c:f90#population work rate#c#, in turn increasing the amount of resources produced on your planet as a whole.
#doc pl note4 title: Mood
#doc pl note4 text: The population on a planet has a level of satisfaction with their living conditions, or #c:09f#mood#c#.\n\nMood is indicated by a number between -1.00 and +1.00. Lower numbers will #c:f90#impede resource and labor production#c#, while better moods will #c:f90#speed it up#c#.\n\nMood is dictated by your supplies of #c:0fa#food#c#, #c:0fa#general goods#c# and #c:0fa#luxury goods#c#, and can be affected when the planet is under attack.
#doc pl note5 title: Construction and Labor
#doc pl note5 text: Building #c:f90#ships#c# and #c:f90#structures#c# does not inherently take time to do. Instead, once all the #c:0fa#resources#c# required for the construction have been collected, and the #c:09f#labor#c# requirements are fulfilled, the project is completed.\n\nThe percentage complete indication on a construction project tells you how many of the resources have been collected for the construction so far.\n\Structures cannot be built if there is an improvement project currently ongoing on the planet.
#doc pl note6 title: Planetary Conditions
#doc pl note6 text: Every planet other than your homeworld has one to three #c:f90#planetary conditions#c# affecting its various statistics.\n\nPlanetary conditions can alter the effectiveness of your factories, the amount of damage your structures can take before succumbing to bombardment, and more.\n\nFor a detailed list of all the possible planetary conditions, please refer to the #c:09f#stellar-pedia#c#.
#doc pl note7 title: Population Work Rate
#doc pl note7 text: The more population is present on a planet, the higher the #c:09f#population work rate#c#. The work rate is a straight multiplier to your base resource incomes, so having more population will increase your resource production by a great deal.\n\nThe population capacity of cities can be improved by leveling up #c:0fa#Sociology#c#, but make sure to have enough food or #c:0fa#Biology#c# tech before doing so, or your people will starve.
#doc pl note8 title: Mood Impact Factor
#doc pl note8 text: As the mood of your population goes up or down, so does the #c:09f#mood impact factor#c#. The impact factor displays how much your factories are producing compared to their base rate due to mood effects.\n\nA happier populace is a more productive populace.
#doc pl note9 title: Worker Efficiency
#doc pl note9 text: If you do not have sufficient population to staff all your structures, some structures will be taken offline, but your factories will operate at a reduced efficiency. If your population is lacking, the #c:09f#worker efficiency#c# indicates at what capacity your production structures are operating.\n\nIf this number goes below 100%, it may be a wise idea to build more cities or investigate your food stores.
#doc pl note10 title: Trade Capacity
#doc pl note10 text: Because your #c:0fa#space ports#c# have a limited trade rate per second, only so many resources can be imported or exported from the bank at a time.\n\nThe #c:09f#trade capacity#c# numbers indicate how much of the total trade rate you are using.\n\nIf you are frequently at the limit of your trade capacity, building more space ports can be advantageous.
#doc pl note11 title: Improvements
#doc pl note11 text: #c:09f#Planetary Improvements#c# can be used to upgrade the planet in certain ways to improve its effectiveness.\n\nThis can range from increasing the number of slots available via terraforming to improving certain aspects of the planet. A full list is available in the category below.\n\Improvements cannot be built if there are structure projects ongoing on the planet.
#doc pl note12 title: Planet Damage
#doc pl note12 text: When a planet is #c:f90#damaged#c#, the structures take the initial damage before the planet itself begins to have \
catastrophic effects under the heavy bombardment. While a planet might suffer due to its mass it will slowly \
heal from all from this damage if not destroyed.\n\n\
However if enough damage is put into a #c:f90#single strike#c# against the planet (10% of its HP), the very enviromental \
effects will slowly render the planet towards being lifeless.\n\n\
When this happens a random number of slots will be destroyed, a random number of these slots will be recoverable via terraforming. \
These will not regenerate, however if the planet is damaged to #c:f90#below 5 slots#c#, over time it will become habitabal again with slots \
regenerating up to 5, to allow a chance to terraform the planet back up again, this will be a long and costly process.

#doc sys title: Solar Systems
#doc sys text: Systems are gravity wells formed around large stars or other objects. They contain planets, asteroids and various other stellar phenomena.
#doc sys note0 title: Stars
#doc sys note0 text: Most solar systems are based around singular or binary stars.\n\nAt sufficiently high technology levels, stars can be attacked and detonated, dealing devastating amounts of damage to all objects unfortunate enough to be in the system at the time.
#doc sys note1 title: Planets
#doc sys note1 text: Most systems contain a handful of planets that can colonized for resource production and ship construction.\n\nWhen attacking an enemy planet, dealing damage will cause #c:09f#population#c# and #c:09f#structures#c# to be killed or destroyed first. A planet with 0 population or 0 structures reverts to being uninhabited and can be re-colonized.\n\nWhen a planet runs out of its own #c:09f#HP#c#, it explodes.
#doc sys note2 title: Asteroids
#doc sys note2 text: A good amount of systems will contain one or several asteroid belts. There are even systems in the form of entire asteroid fields.\n\nAsteroids can be mined for ore by ships equipped with the #c:0fa#mining laser#c# sub system.\n\nWhen an asteroid runs out of ore, it is destroyed.
#doc sys note3 title: System Plane
#doc sys note3 text: Each system has a grid indicating its xz-plane. The plane is helpful to indicate the height of ships in the system, and can serve as a target to create move orders on.\n\nThe thickest lines on the plane form a 1AU by 1AU grid to aid you in determining distances.
#doc sys note4 title: Strength Indicators
#doc sys note4 text: Around the system plane are bars indicating the strength of that empire in the system they encircle.\n\nThe more military you have in a system, the more pips will be displayed in your color.

#doc bridge title: "  Jump Bridge Usage"
#doc bridge text: #c:09f#Remnant Jump Bridges#c# are structures left behind from a long disappeared empire. They allow the connecting to other #c:09f#Jump Bridges#c# that are visible by your empire and #c:f90#when linked#c# allow travel from the original #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c# to the linked one.
#doc bridge note0 title: Linking Jump Bridges
#doc bridge note0 text: To Link a #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c# you must first control the #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c# via taking it over with a #c:f90#Boarding Party#c# equipped vessel. Once successful and you own the #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c# you can then select it, find another #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c# in the Galaxy owned by anyone, right click on it and select #c:f90#"Link Stargate"#c# in a few moments the selected #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c# will be linked to the clicked #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c#. This will be represented by hoving your mouse over the selected #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c# showing the name and system of the link.
#doc bridge note1 title: Travelling the Bridge Network
#doc bridge note1 text: To travel through a #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c# there are two things to be aware of, it cannot be bigger than the #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c# with a #c:f90#scale of 3600#c# and the #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c# must have enough charge to transport the vessel. The #c:f90#charge required#c# is equal to the mass of the initiating vessel with the charge being visible by mousing over the #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c#.\n\nIf both these limitations are met you select your vessel, right click on a #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c# with an #c:f90#active link#c# (can be owned by anyone) and click #c:f90#"Enter Stargate"#c# within a few seconds your vessel will disappear and reappear next to the linked #c:09f#Jump Bridge#c#.

#SP_Cat_SystemTypes: "  System Types"
#SP_SystemTypes_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#System Types\n#hline##c##font#\nThrough out the galaxy there are various different types of systems, from standard single stars to supernovas to neutrino. Some may even contain relics of past empires.

#doc bp title: Blueprints
#doc bp text: Decides capabilities and behavior of ships.
#doc bp note0 title: Ship Scale
#doc bp note0 text: Every blueprint in the game has an assigned #c:f90#scale#c#.\n\nShip scale is a number ranging from the minimum scale to infinity, with larger numbers making for larger ships once the blueprint has been constructed.\n\nBigger ships will have much higher stats and fare better at many tasks, but will also be disproportionally more expensive to build until you level up the #c:0fa#mega construction#c# technology.
#doc bp note1 title: Hulls
#doc bp note1 text: Each blueprint must have exactly one #c:f90#hull#c# added as a sub system to the layout.\n\nThe hull takes an amount of all incoming damage and decides how much #c:09f#sub system space#c# you have to place sub systems in.\n\nFor example, the #c:0fa#light hull#c# has fewer hitpoints and lets through more damage, but provides an extra space slot to add a sub system in.
#doc bp note2 title: Sub System Size
#doc bp note2 text: Like ships, when you place a sub system on a blueprint you can give it a particular #c:f90#size#c#, ranging from #c:0fa#0.125 to 4.0#c#.\n\nThe size of a sub system is how much #c:09f#sub system space#c# it takes up on the hull.\n\nFor overall effectiveness, sub system size is #c:f90#relative to hull scale#c#: a size 0.25 weapon on a scale 40 ship will be as effective as a size 1.0 weapon on a scale 10 ship.
#doc bp note3 title: Armor
#doc bp note3 text: Many ships will also be equipped with layers of #c:f90#armor#c#.\n\nArmor is mounted on the outside of the ship, and does not take up any space on the hull.\n\n\Be warned however, as armor weighs and costs a lot, and will slow down your ship's movement and construction considerably.\n\nIn Galactic Armory each hull has a limited amount of armor available for use on the ship.
#doc bp note4 title: Shields
#doc bp note4 text: Many ships will also be equipped with #c:f90#shields#c#.\n\nShields are generated by shield generators which take up internal space on the ship.\n\n\Shields can be modified with harderners to reduce the amount of damage that gets through them or the ship can be equiped with rechargers which decrease the time they need to recharge to full.\n\nIn Galactic Armory each hull has a limited amount of shield mount points available for use on the ship.
#doc bp note5 title: Sub System Modifiers
#doc bp note5 text: Certain sub systems belong to a category called #c:f90#modifiers#c#. These sub systems do very little on their own, but can be #c:0fa#'linked'#c# to particular types of other sub systems to provide a boost to it.\n\nLinking sub systems is done automatically when placing a link on the blueprint to #c:f90#overlap#c# with another sub system.
#doc bp note6 title: Hull Modifiers
#doc bp note6 text: While classed as a subsystem modifier #c:f90#hull modifiers#c# are a type all of their own. These sub systems do very little on their own, but can be #c:0fa#'linked'#c# to hulls or subsystems to either provide extra space or mount the linked subsystem on the outside of the hull.
#doc bp note7 title: Engines and Acceleration
#doc bp note7 text: In order to move, ships require #c:09f#engines#c#. An engine provides a particular amount of #c:0fa#thrust#c#, which is divided by the combined #c:0fa#mass#c# of all the sub systems on the ship to determine the ship's #c:09f#acceleration#c#.\n\nShips with a higher acceleration will get to their destinations faster and will be more maneuverable in combat.
#doc bp note8 title: Control
#doc bp note8 text: In order for ship sub systems to function, #c:09f#control#c# is required. Control represents the intelligent input provided by humans on a #c:0fa#bridge#c# or control conduits leading from a #c:0fa#computer core#c#.\n\nWithout control, sub systems that need it will go offline one by one. When control runs out entirely, the ship becomes #c:f90#inactive#c# and spend the rest of its time drifting meaninglessly through space until it decays.
#doc bp note9 title: Taking Damage
#doc bp note9 text: When a ship takes damage from enemy weapons fire, the following procedure is follows:\n\n- First, #c:f90#shields#c# and then #c:f90#armor#c# attempt to absorb the damage.\n- If it pierces those, the #c:f90#hull absorbs#c# a percentage of the damage and applies it to itself.\n - Any damage left over after this is #c:f90#applied to the sub systems#c# positioned closest to the direction the ship was hit from.
#doc bp note10 title: Import Docks
#doc bp note10 text: Import Docks are a special subsystem that allows a ship to directly import resources from the galactic bank. However they do have a few limitations on them that you must be aware of to take full usage of them.\n\n\
The Import Dock uses a special empire resource known as #c:f90#Import Trade#c#. The Import Trade available is shown on the galactic bank ticker on the top left of the screen. It is the bottom right hand side resource. This resource is generated by building space ports.\n\n\Upon a space ports construction a a certain amount of this resource is added to the available pool. Similarly upon destruction that amount is subtracted from the avaialable pool. This limits the number of available import docks you can build, and you have to be careful in your decision whether to build a few large ones, or lots of smaller ones.\n\n\
When designing a ship or station with an import dock if you do not have enough #c:f90#Import Trade#c# to support the size of the import dock then you will not be able to save the blueprint.\n\n\If you've created a blueprint with no errors upon construction the resource used by that import dock will be removed from the pool, and upon destruction will be added back to the pool. Be warned if you build many space ports for a temporary boost to the pool and then destroy them after construction the resource will become negative and you won't be able to build more import docks until you once again have a positive number.\n\n\
Import Docks will be effected by #c:red#blockades#c# and so should always be carefully defended and will not function well in an enemy system without support.

#SP_Cat_Blueprint: "  Blueprint Design"
#SP_Blueprint_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Designing a ship in the blueprint editor\n\
#hline##font##c#\
The blueprint editor may very well be the most powerful tool at your disposal as ruler over a star-faring empire. Depending on the traits of your civilization and your level of technology, there is a vast array of subsystems to choose from when creating your own ships. Knowing when to use which subsystems is key to your success in doing so.\n\

#c:f88##font:frank_12#The Basics#font##c#\n\
\n\
Whether youre designing a ship from scratch or modifying an existing design, it is imperative to be clear about its intended purpose. What kind of ship do you need?\n\
\n\
According to this design goal as well as the technology you have access to, you should choose the appropriate subsystems for your new ship. The first choice you will have to make is that of a ship hull.\n\
\n\
Ship hulls come in a lot of different variants, each suited better for some tasks than for others. They differ in many factors, the most important ones being internal space, durability, mass, armor points, shield emitters and costs. Additional features, like electronic countermeasures or the ability to link a weapon system to a spinal mount should be considered as well. The overall scale of the ship or station you are going to create will also play a role in the choice of the hull.\n\
\n\
Once a hull has been chosen, the ship needs to be outfitted with the systems essential for its tasks. That means the expected needs for control, crew, life support and power need to be met in order for the ship to be functioning at all. If at least one of these is insufficient, you will see a warning message at the top of the statistics layout on the right side of the blueprint window. Please note that if it is a critical error, i.e. outfitting more subsystems than can fit into the hull, this will result in the stat calculation being frozen until the critical error is resolved.\n\
\n\
When designing a military ship, it is a good idea to place the most essential systems, like a bridge, computer core or power generator, towards the center of the blueprint. The less vital for the functioning of the ship a system is, the more outwards you should place it. The reason for this is that once the armor is destroyed, those subsystems will soak up the damage first. The most essential subsystems should only ever be exposed after everything else has been destroyed.\n\
\n\
Aside from making sure the ship is functional at all, it will need some sort of propulsion, which should be chosen according to the design goal. Does it need to go fast? Does it need to have a lot of range or flight time? If you are unsure about this, feel free to experiment with different types and sizes of engine. If you are designing any kind of station, you can of course skip this part.\n\
\n\
Once you have chosen the engines, you will see an estimated minimum flight time. This is calculated with the highest permanent fuel consumption possible. While power generators always consume fuel when running, the engines will only activate when the ship is maneuvering. This includes any kind of movement (rotating, accelerating, and decelerating). If the estimated flight time is less than 5 minutes, you will see a warning message; however, it isnt uncommon for fighter craft to have such short flight duration. When adding fuel cells and changing their size, you can see the change in estimated flight time immediately.\n\
\n\
If the ship is a military ship, defenses, armor and shields should be next. Assuming sufficient tech level, you should have access to different types of armor plating as well as different defenses and shield systems. Keeping the design goal in mind, you should add enough of them to give the ship sufficient protection, but not so much that the ship will end up being too slow or under-gunned for its size and purpose. The kind of armor youll want to use will also depend on the enemy. Generally speaking, plate armor is heavy and can only soak up limited amounts of damage. Ablative armor is best against small, fast-firing weapons and some of the weaker beam weapons. Reactive armor is good if you expect the enemy to use heavy guns and large torpedos. The other armor types are either somewhere in-between or completely different from these principles.\n\
\n\
Depending on the purpose of the ship, the next step should be adding weapons and/or the subsystems required for its task. When adding weapon systems, its best to think of a specific doctrine and stick to it. If you want fast, powerful ships that can deal a lot of damage in a short time, you should consider adding powerful short-ranged weaponry like Focused Lasers and Plasma Beams, combined with rack mounts or cooling systems. On the other hand, it could be useful to have a ship that can obliterate enemies long before they are within range of their own weapons. In that case, adding Missile Racks or Heavy Railguns, combined with targeting sensors, might be a good idea. It all depends on the goal you have in mind when designing a ship. Whatever that is, be determined about it.\n\
\n\
Now that youve added some stuff to kill aliens (just in the rare event that you need to, of course), your ship will probably have either insufficient ammo storage or power supply. While insufficient power supply is easy to spot because you will get a warning message, there is no such thing as a minimum amount of ammunition your ships can carry. Ultimately it is up to you to decide how long your ships will be able to fire without the need to re-supply. To make things easier, have a look at the statistics tab located just right of the layout editor tab. Near the top of the overview screen, the firing time will be given in hours, minutes and seconds. If there is no firing time, the ship either doesnt have ammunition-based weaponry or it is completely self-sufficient in those regards (probably thanks to ammunition fabricators or matter generators). In case you are only using energy-based weapon systems, your main concern will be power instead. If you want to ensure the power stability of your ship, the net power generation should be positive, probably at least a few percent ahead of the estimated maximum power consumption.\n\
\n\
If you think you added enough of everything mentioned and you still have some space left to use, you could add some additional subsystems. For most combat ships, and especially computer-controlled ones, repair bays are a great thing to have. Though they do draw metal from the galactic bank while repairing your ship, having a small drain on your economy for improved ship survival is something you should consider. Unfortunately, regular repair bays, as well as crew quarters or integrated command centers, can not repair your ship while under fire. So if a ship is severely damaged and still under fire, a tactical retreat may very well be a wise option. This limitation does not apply to repair tools, repair facilities and nanite repair units, though.\n

#SP_Cat_PlanetGovernors: "  Planet Governors"
#SP_PlanetGovernors:#c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Planetary Governors\n\
#hline##font##c#\n\
Planetary governors are automated building lists distributed to planets.  The default governor that is used for new planets that you have freshly colonized is set in the Empire window located on the top-bar.  Note that this governor must be set in advance at this time for the new planet to receive your colonization instructions when the colony is founded.  You may change the governor attached to that planet, and any other planet, after the colony has been established.\n\
\n\
#c:0d0#How the lists work:#c#  The numbered list for every governor describes the priority of each line.  Each line is checked to make sure it has been executed; if it has, then it proceeds to the next priority in sequence from lowest number to highest.  It continues checking against those priorities forever (or until you turn off the governor).\n\
\n\
#img:sparks# What's "Weight"? #font# Weight is the likelihood that something will be picked to be built.  The higher the number, the more likely that structure will be picked.\n\

#tab##c:f80#Rennovate Only#c#\n\
This governor will only rennovate structures on the planet.  It greatly prefers structures that are more out of date than others.\n\
#c:fd0#Caution: Will not replace any structures lost due to planetary warfare.#c#

#SP_Cat_PlanetConditions: "  Planet Conditions"
#SP_PlanetConditions_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Planet Conditions\n#hline##font##c#\n\
Planets are highly diverse in their environments and their levels of hostility to inhabitants. \
Sometimes rewarding your brave settlers with vast riches, at other times making construction \
difficult due to harsh circumstances. Sometimes even both. \n\n\
Because of this, different planet conditions will frequently be encountered while expanding \
your empire. Their names and descriptions are displayed here.

#SP_Cat_Improvements: "  Improvements"
#SP_Improvements_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Planetary Improvements#hline##font##c#\n\
As technology improves, we find ways to use this technology for the good of our settlers. \
We can improve the very nature of their planets in a multitude of ways, from creating more living \
soace via terraforming, to improving their ability to grow food to support an expanding population. \n\n\
However with some improvements, we must also limit the planet in other ways, they are not to be used \
lightly but decided upon with care.

#SP_Cat_SubSystems: Sub Systems
#SP_SubSystems_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems\n#hline##c##font:frank_11#\nSub Systems are the key components of a ship.\nFor more information about specific sub systems click on a category:\n\n#c:link##tab:110##link:h:sp:ss_hulls#Hulls#link##tab:310##link:h:sp:ss_support#Support Systems#link#\n#tab:110##link:h:sp:ss_storage#Storage#link##tab:310##link:h:sp:ss_control#Control#link#\n#tab:110##link:h:sp:ss_engines#Engines#link##tab:310##link:h:sp:ss_modifiers#System Modifiers#link#\n#tab:110##link:h:sp:ss_other#Miscellaneous#link##tab:310##link:h:sp:ss_projweapon#Ballistic Weapons#link#\n#tab:110##link:h:sp:ss_beamenergyweapon#Energy Weapons#link##tab:310##link:h:sp:ss_missileweapon#Missile Weapons#link#\n#tab:110##link:h:sp:ss_fighterbomberweapon#Fighter/Bomber Weapons#link##tab:310##link:h:sp:ss_defense#Defensive Systems#link#\n#tab:110##link:h:sp:ss_armor#Armor#link##tab:310##link:h:sp:ss_shields#Shields#link#\n#tab:110##link:h:sp:ss_specweapon#Special Weapons#link

#SP_Cat_SS_Hulls: "  Hulls"
#SP_SS_Hulls_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Hulls\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#\nEvery ship design needs exactly one hull, and the choice of hull will have a significant impact on how a ship can perform. Whenever a hit pierces any armor or shields, the hull takes a percent of the damage, protecting important Sub Systems. When a hull loses all of its health, the ship will explode.

#SP_Cat_SS_Power: "  Power"
#SP_SS_Power_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Power\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#\nPower provides a critical function that without a ship could not function. This can be provided in a reactor, solar power array or a battery.

#SP_Cat_SS_Engines: "  Engines"
#SP_SS_Engines_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Engines\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#\nEngines provide some amount of thrust that allows a vessel to move. More massive ships will accelerate more slowly. Ships without engines are considered Stations, and cannot move.

#SP_Cat_SS_Support: "  Support"
#SP_SS_Support_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Support\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#

#SP_Cat_SS_Storage: "  Storage"
#SP_SS_Storage_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Storage\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#

#SP_Cat_SS_ProjWeapons: "  Ballistic Weapons"
#SP_SS_ProjWeapons_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Ballistic Weapons\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#\nBallistic Weapons utilize unguided projectiles to deal kinetic damage by striking the target with high impact velocity. They always deal full damage, but can be evaded past their effective range.

#SP_Cat_SS_BeamEnergyWeapons: "  Energy Weapons"
#SP_SS_BeamEnergyWeapons_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Energy Weapons\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#\nEnergy weapons deal damage through a combination of heat, electricity, kinetic damage or other means.\nBeams travel at lightspeed, so they always hit. The damage of an energy weapon decreases past it's effective range, however.

#SP_Cat_SS_MissileWeapons: "  Missile Weapons"
#SP_SS_MissileWeapons_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Missile Weapons\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#\nMissile Weapons include all guided and self-propelled projectile weapons like Torpedos and Missile Racks.\nThey can hit targets reliably over extreme ranges and offer great damage. Their main drawback is the possibility of being intercepted by point defense.

#SP_Cat_SS_SpecWeapons: "  Special Weapons"
#SP_SS_SpecWeapons_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Special Weapons\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#\nWeapon systems of extraordinary firepower or unconventional weapons with unique properties are classified as Special Weapons.\nThey can be extremely valuable if used correctly.

#SP_Cat_SS_FighterBomberWeapons: "  Fighter & Bomber Weapons"
#SP_SS_FighterBomberWeapons_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Fighter and Bomber Weapons\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#\nThese weapons are specifically designed for use with fighter or bomber hulls.\nTheir range and ammunition capacity is usually limited to allow for a maximization of firepower.

#SP_Cat_SS_Defense: "  Defense"
#SP_SS_Defense_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Defense\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#\nDefensive Sub Systems consist of both passive and active defenses.

#SP_Cat_SS_Armor: "  Armor"
#SP_SS_Armor_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Armor\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#\nArmor is a protective shell that takes damage from all sides. Armors also reduce the damage of a given hit by some amount (but no lower than 20% of the original damage). Each plate must be destroyed before the next is hit.

#SP_Cat_SS_Shields: "  Shields"
#SP_SS_Shields_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Shields\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#\nShields are an energy-based protective shell that takes damage from all sides. As shields take damage, more and more will pass through the shields and hit the armor/hull. Shields have a natural regeneration rate. Shield Hardeners can be used to reduce how much damage leaks through a given layer of shielding.

#SP_Cat_SS_Modifiers: "  Modifiers"
#SP_SS_Modifiers_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Modifiers\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#\nSub System Modifiers connect to other Sub Systems to alter their effectiveness. To use, place a single modifier over a another system. When position correctly, they will both light up.\nNote that only one modifier may be equipped to a single Sub System.

#SP_Cat_SS_Docks: "  Docks"
#SP_SS_Docks_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Docks\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#\nDocks allow the importing and exporting of resources directly to and from the Galactic Bank.

#SP_Cat_SS_Other: "  Other"
#SP_SS_Other_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Sub Systems - Other\n#hline##font:frank_11##c#

#SP_Cat_Research: Research Fields
#SP_Cat_Research_Intro: #c:0d0##font:goodtimes_14#Research\n#hline##c##font#\nAs the driving force behind technological progress, be it for purposes of destruction or creation, research is a necessity for any galactic empire. Researching areas of interest leads to improved ship components and planetary structures, and might even unlock previously unknown technology to give your faction an edge over competitors.\n\nIf you wish to speed along the process of discovery, every area of technology has a number of hunches and guesses that you may pour your funding into. These can lead to startling new areas of research, but may very well end up as dead ends, wasting your precious research time in the process.\n\nBelow is a list off all available research topics, click one of their names to see more about the things it improves and unlocks.
